The author cites examples from recent elections where Democrats who heavily pandered to women's issues ultimately lost to their Republican opponents.","The author argues that Hillary Clinton's focus on women in her campaign may not be the best strategy, as recent elections have shown that overplaying to one gender can backfire. They suggest that Clinton should focus on appealing to men as well, rather than solely targeting women.","Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout emphasizes women and being a woman, but her strategy may not be the best as overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly in previous elections. Democrats who pandered to women at the expense of real issues and men crashed and burned in various states. Exit polls in 2014 showed a 16-point margin for men voting for Republicans over Democrats, and a four-point margin for women voting for Democrats.","Hillary Clinton's campaign rollout emphasizes women and being a woman, but this strategy has failed in the past. The 2014 midterm elections saw the death of the ""war on women"" meme, as Democrats who pandered to women at the expense of real issues and men crashed and burned. Voters in red and blue states cared about more than just reproductive issues, and false cries of sexism didn't work. While Democrats had a deficit among men, Republicans had a larger deficit among women.","The article discusses Hillary Clinton's campaign strategy of focusing on women and being a woman. However, it argues that this strategy has failed in previous elections and suggests that Clinton should focus on appealing to men instead.

The article notes that Clinton's strategy is predictable and has been used by both male and female candidates in the past. However, the article points out that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population has failed spectacularly in recent elections, regardless of the gender of the candidate. The article suggests that Clinton should focus on courting men instead of running a woman-centered campaign.","The article argues that Hillary Clinton's focus on women in her campaign may not be the best strategy, as it failed in previous elections. It suggests that she should focus on appealing to men as well, as they play a significant role in the outcome of elections.
